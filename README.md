# Hydra

**A modern, cross-platform software KVM** — share one keyboard and mouse across Mac, Windows, and Linux by moving the cursor to the edge of the screen. A spiritual successor to Synergy and Barrier, with end to end encryption, support for online relays to bridge networks or VPN connections, and sending key input as pre-resolved Unicode characters to eliminate keyboard layout issues.

## A day in the life

**The commuting laptop.** Walk into the office, dock your laptop, and Hydra activates your Office profile automatically — cursor flows between screens, files copy across with one hotkey. Unplug at 5pm: the dock-detected profile drops. Get home and join the home WiFi: Hydra silently switches to your Home profile, where the same laptop now controls a mini-PC plugged into the TV. At a coffee shop with neither network: Hydra idles silently — there's nothing to connect to.

**The Raspberry Pi as a wireless keyboard.** A headless Pi tucked behind the TV runs Hydra in remote-only mode. Plug any USB keyboard and mouse into it, and they instantly control your Mac across the room — no display server, no Xorg, just evdev and a network cable.

**Typing foreign characters across layouts.** Norwegian master, US slave — type `å` on the master and `å` arrives correctly on the slave, even though the slave's keyboard has no key for it. Hydra resolves characters to Unicode on the master before transmission; dead-key composition (`' + a` → `á`) works the same way. No "force all machines to use the same layout" workarounds needed.

**The shared office screen.** A 98-inch display on the conference room wall runs as a slave. Any of the five people around the table can slide their cursor onto it — whoever gets there first takes control. Put up a diagram, hand off to a colleague, pass it back — no cables, no HDMI switches, no "can you share your screen?" interruptions.

**The VPN problem, solved.** Your work laptop is on the corporate VPN; it can't see your personal machine sitting right next to it on the LAN. Drop a Styx container on a cheap VPS, paste the relay config into both machines' `hydra.conf`, and they connect through the relay as if they were on the same network — end-to-end encrypted, no port forwarding, no changes to the VPN.

## Install

Run the binary directly to try Hydra out, or use `--install` to set it up as a service / LaunchAgent that auto-starts on login and survives reboots.

**macOS (Apple Silicon):**
```bash
curl -L https://github.com/PacAnimal/hydra/releases/latest/download/hydra-osx-arm64.tar.gz | tar xz
./hydra             # run directly — good for testing, no install needed
./hydra --install   # installs as a login item, auto-starts on login
```
`--install` registers a LaunchAgent, clears the quarantine flag, and starts Hydra immediately. Grant Accessibility permission when prompted: System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility → enable Hydra. To remove: `./hydra --uninstall`.

**Windows (x64):**

Download [hydra-win-x64.zip](https://github.com/PacAnimal/hydra/releases/latest/download/hydra-win-x64.zip), extract, then run:
```
hydra.exe             # run directly — good for testing, no install needed
hydra.exe --install   # install as a Windows service (auto-start, survives logout)
```
A UAC prompt will appear for `--install`. Because Hydra installs as a `LocalSystem` service, it stays active on the Windows login and lock screens — mouse and keyboard control works even before you sign in. To remove: `hydra.exe --uninstall`.

**Linux (x64):**
```bash
curl -L https://github.com/PacAnimal/hydra/releases/latest/download/hydra-linux-x64.tar.gz | tar xz
chmod +x hydra
./hydra
```

**Linux (arm64 / Raspberry Pi):**
```bash
curl -L https://github.com/PacAnimal/hydra/releases/latest/download/hydra-linux-arm64.tar.gz | tar xz
chmod +x hydra
./hydra
```

All releases are [self-contained](https://github.com/PacAnimal/hydra/releases) — no .NET runtime installation required.

> **Linux with display:** Requires X11 with XInput2. Wayland is not yet supported.

> **Linux headless (no display):** See [Remote-only / Raspberry Pi setup](docs/CONFIGURATION.md#headless-linux-no-display-server).

### Terminal control center

Open Hydra's local cross-platform TUI in another terminal:

```bash
./hydra tui
./hydra tui --config /path/to/hydra.conf
```

The control center shows the running process, active profile, relay, screens, peers, current routing state, exact relay network interface/socket, embedded-relay peer interfaces, traffic counters, and a bounded live log. It can request a relay reconnect or Hydra restart, and can validate and atomically save `hydra.conf`. The Configuration tab has a sectioned form for common settings and a complete JSON text editor; switching between them preserves advanced fields. Hovering an option or moving keyboard focus to it displays contextual help. Configuration editing remains available when Hydra is offline. Relay passwords and `networkConfig` values are hidden unless you explicitly reveal them in Text mode.

The TUI controls only the Hydra instance on the same machine and config path. Closing it does not stop Hydra. Use `Esc` to quit the TUI.

## Quickstart

Create `hydra.conf` next to the binary on **each machine**.

**Master** (the machine with the physical keyboard and mouse):

```json
{
  "name": "desktop",
  "profiles": [{
    "mode": "Master",
    "embeddedStyxServer": { "port": 5000, "password": "secret" },
    "hosts": [
      { "name": "desktop", "neighbours": [{ "direction": "right", "name": "laptop" }] },
      { "name": "laptop" }
    ]
  }]
}
```

**Slave** (the machine that receives input):

```json
{
  "name": "laptop",
  "profiles": [{
    "mode": "Slave",
    "embeddedStyx": { "server": "http://192.168.1.10:5000", "password": "secret" }
  }]
}
```

Replace `192.168.1.10` with the master's IP address. Run `./hydra` on both machines. Move the cursor past the right edge of the master's screen — it appears on the slave.

### Hotkeys

All hotkeys use **Ctrl+Alt+Super** (Super = ⌘ on macOS, Win key on Windows):

| Hotkey | Action |
|--------|--------|
| `Ctrl+Alt+Super+L` | Toggle cursor lock — pin to current screen, or release to roam freely |
| `Ctrl+Alt+Super+M` | Toggle relative mouse mode on the current remote screen (useful for games) |
| `Ctrl+Alt+Super+C` | Copy selected files/folders to Hydra's cross-machine clipboard (macOS, Windows) |
| `Ctrl+Alt+Super+V` | Paste previously copied files to the current machine |

For cross-network setups (different LANs or over a VPN), see [Networking with Styx](docs/CONFIGURATION.md#networking-with-styx).

## Config editor

The easiest way to set up multi-machine layouts, Styx relay configs, and network-aware profiles is the **[Hydra Config Editor](https://hydra-config.c-net.org/)** — a web UI that lets you visually arrange screens and download a ready-to-use `hydra.conf`.

---

## Features

- Seamless cursor transitions in any direction (left, right, up, down)
- **Multi-monitor support** — multiple local and remote monitors, auto-detected at startup and on connect/disconnect
- Flexible layout: L-shaped, grids, or any topology
- **Range-based neighbours** — split edges to route to different hosts by cursor position
- **Per-screen scale** — control cursor speed on each remote screen
- Full keyboard forwarding including dead keys and special characters — resolved on the master using its keyboard layout
- Mouse button and scroll forwarding
- **Clipboard sync** — text and images synced automatically when switching machines (all platforms)
- **File transfer** — cross-machine copy/paste of files and folders via hotkey (macOS and Windows)
- **Media key forwarding** — volume, playback, brightness keys forwarded to the active machine
- **Screensaver sync** — activating the screensaver on the master locks all connected slaves
- **Windows login screen support** — installed as a system service, Hydra stays active on the lock and login screens
- End-to-end encrypted relay via **Styx** for machines on different networks
- **Multiple masters per slave** — several machines can share a single slave display; whoever moves their cursor onto it takes control
- **Remote-only mode** — use a headless Linux machine (e.g. Raspberry Pi) as a dedicated input forwarder with no local screen
- **Terminal control center** — monitor, control, and configure the local Hydra instance from macOS, Windows, Linux, or SSH
